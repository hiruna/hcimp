# hcimp (How Common Is My Password) by hiruna

## Brief

hcimp is a simple tool to determine whether the password that the user has entered is commonly used.


## How it works

The application uses a large password list ```<pending approval to use the dictionary file>``` in order find a match. 

The user enters a password and it is searched through the entire dictionary list and the passwords that contains the user input are returned.

For an example, if the user enters "admin", passwords containing "admin" are returned.
